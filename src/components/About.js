            Hi everyone, I am Huawen Lei. I am a Melbourne-based Software Developer with a background in Telecommunication and Electronics Engineering.

            <div>
            Having majored and worked in Telecommunication and Electronics for several years, I gradually realize the importance of software. I think if I want to go further in the technical field, software skills are necessary. It is also an area I can learn new technology and challenge myself, and develop myself all the time. So I start learning Software Engineering skills and finding a related job.

            <div>
            I had lots of work experience and projects in software and hardware in Australia. I also have experience working in cross-functional teams and good problem-solving skills. If you need my skills, please get in touch with me.
